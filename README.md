##Goal Getter

An app that transforms the burden of both short and long-term goals from overwhelming into a ‘one-day-at-a-time’ approach.

Whether you plan to lose weight, train for a marathon or learn a new language, Goal Getter will automatically populate your daily schedule with what you need to do - today - to keep you on track. 

Goal Getter can also post to your Facebook. Having friends and family cheer you on and watch your progress can greatly boost the required motivation to push through consistently in what can often seem like too much to take on.

Goal Getter plans your days according to what’s needed for you to be successful in your goals. And if you miss a day, that’s ok, it’ll recalculate everything for you.

####The future belongs to the ones willing to embrace today.
